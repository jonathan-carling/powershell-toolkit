# PowerShell Toolkit

A collection of reusable, safety‑first PowerShell utilities designed for real‑world operations, automation, and workflow optimisation.  
Every script in this toolkit follows the same philosophy:

- **Preview before action** (dry‑run support wherever possible)
- **Clear, color‑coded output** for fast operator feedback
- **Parameterisation over hard‑coding**
- **Logging and traceability** baked in
- **Modular, reusable functions** shared across scripts

Whether you're validating files, flattening directories, backing up data, or automating system tasks, this toolkit aims to be your reliable multi‑tool.

## 🧩 Philosophy

This toolkit is built around a few core principles:

- **Safety first** — destructive operations require explicit confirmation
- **Transparency** — logs, transcripts, and summaries for every run
- **Modularity** — scripts share common helpers for consistency
- **Operator-friendly** — readable output, clear warnings, and rollback options
